I am a Computer Science and Engineering undergraduate with a strong interest in Machine Learning, automation, and emerging technologies. My portfolio showcases hands-on 
projects that apply theoretical concepts to real-world problems, including geospatial sentiment analysis for urban water scarcity detection and an automation-based Journey 
Bot developed using UiPath.

I have a solid foundation in programming with C, Java, and Python, along with experience in UI/UX design and data-driven problem solving. I enjoy building practical, 
user-focused solutions by combining machine learning, NLP, and automation workflows. Through continuous learning, certifications in Generative AI, data acquisition, 
and cloud fundamentals, I aim to grow as a versatile engineer and contribute effectively to innovative technology-driven teams.
